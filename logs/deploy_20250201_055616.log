node.exe : npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory. Do not use it. Check out 
lru-cache if you want a good and tested way to coalesce async requests by a key value, which is much more comprehensive 
and powerful.

npm warn deprecated @humanwhocodes/config-array@0.13.0: Use @eslint/config-array instead
npm warn deprecated stable@0.1.8: Modern JS already guarantees Array#sort() is a stable sort, so this library is 
deprecated. See the compatibility table on MDN:
